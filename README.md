In this module, you will use machine learning to determine if the first stage of Falcon 9 will land successfully. You will split your data into training data and test data to find the best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression. Then find the method that performs best using test data.
Learning Objectives
Split the data into training testing data
Train different classification models
Optimize the Hyperparameter grid search
Utilize your machine learning skills to build a predictive model to help a business function more efficiently

================

 In this lab, we will build a machine
learning pipeline to predict if the first stage of the Falcon 9 lands successfully. This will include: Preprocessing, allowing us
to standardize our data, and Train_test_split, allowing us to split
our data into training and testing data, We will train the model and perform Grid Search, allowing us to find the hyperparameters that
allow a given algorithm to perform best. Using the best hyperparameter values, we will determine the model with the
best accuracy using the training data. You will test Logistic Regression,
Support Vector machines, Decision Tree Classifier, and K-nearest neighbors. Finally, we will output the confusion matrix.
